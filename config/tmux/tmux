	# Why Use Tmux
	In a traditional Linux Terminal, users can only work on one task per session and can’t continue their progress after disconnecting. Tmux helps resolve this issue by providing these benefits:
		- Task and session management. System administrators can create multiple sessions to group tasks. They can also link windows, replicating one process on another for consistency.
		- Multitasking. Users can detach from a session and reconnect to where they left off. It allows for efficient multitasking since they can work on multiple tasks seamlessly.
		- Remote work. The tmux server preserves every running process, even when the user disconnects. It lets you reliably work on a remote system like a VPS without worrying about the SSH connection
		- Long-running processes. Processes in tmux will remain active until the user terminates it. This feature is helpful for tasks like logging events or deploying an application.
